##TIMETABLE IMPLEMENTATION.

##HTML AND CSS TABLE CREATION.
HTML tables are built using the <table> element, with rows defined by <tr> (table row) and 
cells defined by <td> (table data) or <th> (table header).

To organize data clearly, you can use <thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot>.

## CSS STYLING IN TABLE.
CSS is then applied to improve readability and style.

You can add borders, padding, background colors, text alignment, and even responsive designs. 
For modern layouts, however, tables should be used only for tabular data (not for page layout), 

while CSS Grid or Flexbox is recommended for structure.
